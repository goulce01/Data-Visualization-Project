_Note that the Winter and Summer Games were held in the same year up until 1992. After that, they staggered them such that Winter Games occur on a four year cycle starting with 1994, then Summer in 1996, then Winter in 1998, and so on._
<br/>
<br/>
## We also pulled data from a Wikipedia page detailing the [2016 Summer Olympics Women's Marathon results.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_at_the_2016_Summer_Olympics_â€“_Women%27s_marathon)

### As a result of the size of our dataset we aimed to narrow our scope by focusing on the marathon specifically. This was the sport in which we analyzed the most extensively. Specifically, we make many comparisons between male and female athletes who competed in the marathon event.
